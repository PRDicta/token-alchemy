# Commercial License — Token Alchemy

Token Alchemy is dual-licensed. The open-source edition is available under the [GNU Affero General Public License v3.0](LICENSE). A commercial license is available for organizations that need to embed, distribute, or deploy Token Alchemy without AGPL obligations.

## When you need a commercial license

The AGPL-3.0 requires that if you modify Token Alchemy and make it available over a network (including as part of a SaaS product), you must release your complete source code under the same license. A commercial license removes this requirement.

You likely need a commercial license if you are:

- **An OEM or ISV** embedding Token Alchemy in a proprietary product
- **A SaaS provider** offering Token Alchemy's capabilities as part of a hosted service
- **An enterprise** that cannot comply with AGPL source-code disclosure requirements
- **A VAR** bundling Token Alchemy with other commercial software

All commercial licenses are **perpetual** — pay once, use forever on the version you purchased.

- Use in proprietary and closed-source products
- Access to the same fully-functional codebase as the open-source edition
- No license keys, no telemetry, no feature gating

## Personal and open-source use

If you are using Token Alchemy for personal projects, academic research, or open-source work where you can comply with AGPL-3.0 terms, no commercial license is needed. The open-source edition is fully functional.

## Definitions

A **developer** is any individual who directly interacts with, modifies, integrates, or deploys Token Alchemy as part of their work. Individuals who merely use a product or service that incorporates Token Alchemy are not counted as developers.

## Sublicensing

Commercial licenses are not sublicensable. You may distribute Token Alchemy as part of your product, but your customers may not redistribute it further without their own license or written consent from Dicta Technologies Inc.

## Termination

Violation of any term of this license automatically terminates your rights under it. Upon termination, you must cease all use and distribution of Token Alchemy. Termination does not entitle the licensee to a refund.
